# this simple code helps in displaying country's time.

in the code it accepts two input which is then used to deternine the time of that users from his country.


> the First input accepts users name.
> the second accepts the users country, in any format.

## limitations of this code
as of this date 02/08/2023 the code can't tell all the  time if a country has more than  one timezones. it  only tell's the first timezone in the list.
